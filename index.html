			Oh hi there! I'm Adrian Del Balso, UX/UI designer at <a href='http://www.amicushq.com'>Amicus</a>. I was born and raised in Montreal, influenced by its language politics, underground music and ethnic foods. During my travels, mainly in Latin America, I've tried to understand how people see the aesthetic of their place. How does someone from Buenos Aires see the world compared to a New Yorker? I've since grown passionate about the idea that technology can shape cities by crafting the path of their development, and design fundamentally guides that process.

		<h1 class="workSectionTitle">these are some of my designs</h1>
		<div id="mobile">
			<h1 class="title">grapple</h1>
			<div class="imgWrapper">
				<img class="app left" src="images/Grapple-Splash-Screen.png">
				<img class="app"  src="images/Successful-Campaign2.png">
			</div>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>A weekend design hack, Grapple is a group funding app. This project was an exercise in absolute simplicity. The flow is terribly simple while achieving the main purpose - getting your buddies to pitch in for a group event.</p>

			<h1 class="title">landmarker</h1>
			<div class="imgWrapper">
				<img class="app left" src="images/Landmarker-Splash-Screen.png">
				<img class="app"  src="images/Landmarker-Home.png">
			</div>
			<br><br>
			<p>My first real interaction design project - EVER. I had no idea what I was doing, but this project spurred my passion for UI design.</p>
			<p>Landmarker is a history map of New York City. Quite simply, it consists of pins that represent designated landmarks in the city. Each landmark's description was written by us, including many original photographs. No scraping of wikipedia involved, just a fun project to appease a passion for the history of New York.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="web">
			<h1>patronhood</h1>
			<div class="imgWrapper">
				<img src="images/Patronhood1.png">
			</div>
			<p>Patronhood was a crowdfunding platform for urban projects. It was founded by myself, <a href="https://twitter.com/sacshu">Sachin Shukla</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonlagaac">Jason Lagaac</a>. The main challenge we faced while designing Patronhood was achieving the same functionality goal as kickstarter while differentiating ourselves for a niche of crowdfunders.</p>

			<h1>voyage</h1>
			<div class="imgWrapper">
				<img src="images/voyage_landing_page.png">
				<img src="images/voyage_search.png">
				<img src="images/voyage_map.png">
			</div>
			<p>Another weekend design hack. I was lost in a daydream one evening recalling the best of my experiences travelling, and thought it would be fun solving the problem of what to do in a new city.</p>
			<p>The content would be submitted by locals eager to share their favorite meanderings in their cities. They would create a mapped walking path with pins indicating worthy stops along the way. Travelers would find appropriate walks by inputing their preferences, and they would find walks that are a suitable fit.</p>
			<p>I never meant to bring this one to life, though now and again I look back at it and wonder.</p>

		<p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.</p>
		<p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.</p>

		<p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</p>
