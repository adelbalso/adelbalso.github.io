		<p>Oh hi there! I'm Adrian Del Balso. I'm currently the lead designer at <a href='http://www.amicushq.com'>Amicus</a>.</p>
    <p>
      I was born and raised in Montreal, influenced by its language politics, underground music and ethnic foods.

    <p>
      I've traversed many disciplines and have pursued a variety of projects, but ultimately my passion lies in exploring the role of design in building a better world.

		<h1 class="workSectionTitle">these are some of my designs</h1>

    <div id="web">
      <h1>amicus</h1>
      <div class="imgWrapper">
        <img src="images/Amicus1.jpg" alt="Amicus Call Tool">
      </div>
      <p>
        The Amicus call tool offers the opportunity to design an interaction that stretches beyond the web browser. The interface provides users with basic information about the prospect, a call script, and call actions. They dial in to the tool with their phones or directly through their computer, initiating an auto-dialing call session.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users of this tool are essentially interacting with three interfaces: the web app, their phone (or headphones/microphone if they dial in with their computer), and the human being they are speaking to. There are obvious frustrations here, but those are mitigated by the user's commitment to the organization they're calling on behalf of.
      </p>
      <p>
        In maintaining and improving this tool, we need to take a close look at our analytics and respond to data patterns, but we also need to respect the user's emotional commitment to the cause. They will put up with a lot to make these calls. We must therefore be incredibly empathetic in order to provide them a beautiful experience.
      </p>
      <div class="imgWrapper">
        <a href="http://www.amicushq.com" target="_blank"><img src="images/Amicus2.jpg" alt="Amicus Homepage"></a>
      </div>
      <p>
        The Amicus homepage serves a single purpose - to generate quality leads. Though we appeal to basic human psychology with a large banner photograph and literal pointing to a prominent call to action, we've created a natural filter by having 4 fields in our signup form.
      </p>

      <h1>luster</h1>
      <div class="imgWrapper">
        <a href="http://luster.io" target="_blank"><img src="images/Luster1.jpg" alt="Luster Homepage"></a>
        <a href="http://luster.io" target="_blank"><img src="images/Luster2.jpg" alt="Luster App"></a>
      </div>
      <p>Luster is a simple hosting platform for static sites with git-based deployment. <a href="https://twitter.com/coderzach">Zach Smith</a> and I are tackling a very unsexy dev-ops problem with a user experience that aims to make the hosting process as frictionless and delightful as possible.</p>

      <h1>patronhood</h1>
      <div class="imgWrapper">
        <img src="images/Patronhood1.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>Patronhood was a crowdfunding platform for urban projects. It was founded by myself, <a href="https://twitter.com/sacshu">Sachin Shukla</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonlagaac">Jason Lagaac</a>. The main challenge we faced while designing Patronhood was achieving the same functionality goal as kickstarter while differentiating ourselves for a niche of crowdfunders.</p>

      <h1>voyage</h1>
      <div class="imgWrapper">
        <img src="images/voyage_landing_page.jpg">
        <img src="images/voyage_search.jpg">
        <img src="images/voyage_map.jpg">
      </div>
      <p>Another weekend design hack. I was lost in a daydream one evening recalling the best of my experiences travelling, and thought it would be fun solving the problem of what to do in a new city.</p>
      <p>The content would be submitted by locals eager to share their favorite meanderings in their cities. They would create a mapped walking path with pins indicating worthy stops along the way. Travelers would find appropriate walks by inputing their preferences, and they would find walks that are a suitable fit.</p>
      <p>I never meant to bring this one to life, though now and again I look back at it and wonder.</p>
    </div>

		<div id="mobile">
      <h1 class="title">yumbin</h1>
      <div class="imgWrapper">
        <a href="http://www.yumbin.com" target="_blank"><img src="images/Yumbin1.jpg" alt="" class="app left"></a>
        <a href="http://www.yumbin.com" target="_blank"><img src="images/Yumbin2.jpg" alt="" class="app"></a>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
        Yumbin is a self-checkout mini market. They are located in offices, where users can grab a snack and purchase them directly from their phones. The app does not need to market the products at all - that is the task of the yumbin itself. Users simply need to have a frictionless checkout experience. My emphasis in designing this app was reducing all possible points of dropoff and nothing more.
      </p>
			<h1 class="title">grapple</h1>
			<div class="imgWrapper">
				<img class="app left" src="images/Grapple-Splash-Screen.jpg">
				<img class="app"  src="images/Successful-Campaign2.jpg">
			</div>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>A weekend design hack, Grapple is a group funding app. This project was an exercise in absolute simplicity. The flow is terribly simple while achieving the main purpose - getting your buddies to pitch in for a group event.</p>

			<h1 class="title">landmarker</h1>
			<div class="imgWrapper">
				<img class="app left" src="images/Landmarker-Splash-Screen.jpg">
				<img class="app"  src="images/Landmarker-Home.jpg">
			</div>
			<br><br>
			<p>My first real interaction design project - EVER. I had no idea what I was doing, but this project spurred my passion for UI design.</p>
			<p>Landmarker is a history map of New York City. Quite simply, it consists of pins that represent designated landmarks in the city. Each landmark's description was written by us, including many original photographs. No scraping of wikipedia involved, just a fun project to appease a passion for the history of New York.</p>

		<p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.</p>
		<p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.</p>

		<p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</p>
